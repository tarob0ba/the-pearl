I like Esperanto. While it has its drawbacks, it's certainly a neat language to learn. I especially like that its (relative) ease makes learning the language very rewarding because it is possible to progress quickly with study. In this post, I'm going to give you an short overview of the language's grammar.

## Background

Before we begin, it helps to understand what the language is. Esperanto _isn't_ everyone's cup of tea[^1], despite what a vocal minority of Esperantists preach.

Esperanto is an international auxiliary language (IAL) created in 1887 by a Polish ophthalmologist named L. L. Zamenhof. Zamenhof first described the language in _Unua Libro_, published in 1887. In 1905, Zamenhof published the _Fundamento de Esperanto_, the standard for Esperanto today.

Zamenhof's goal for the language was to bridge linguistic barriers between different groups. His philosophy was reflected in the language's name, _esperanto_, which can be translated into English as "one who hopes."

## Orthography & Phonology

Esperanto's alphabet has 28 letters; it is a modified Latin alphabet. The language is spelled phonetically, meaning that everything is spelled how it sounds.

## Grammar

### Nouns

Unlike English, there is no indefinite article (English _a_, _an_). The definite article is _la_ (English _the_).

All nouns end in **-o**. To make a noun plural, **-j** is added. When the noun is in the accusative case, **-n** is added.

The accusative case in Esperanto is used to mark the direct object in a sentence (i.e., whatever is being acted upon). For example, in the sentence "I kicked the ball," the ball is the direct object, as the subject of the sentence, me, is kicking it.

Examples:

- **libro** - a book
- **la libroj** - the books
- **Mi legis la librojn.** - I read the books.
  - Nouns can have both the accusative ending and the plural ending, ordered as **-jn**

### Adjectives

Adjectives end with the **-a** suffix. Adjectives agree with nouns in case and number.

The word _pli_ is equivalent to the English _more_, and the superlative is expressed with the word _plej_.

Comparisons are made with the conjunction _ol_.

Examples:

- **la bruna hundo** - the brown dog
- **La hundoj estas pli grandaj ol la kato.** - The dogs are bigger than the cat.

### Pronouns

Esperanto has a similar pronoun system to English[^2].

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th class="table-head">Singular</th>
    <th class="table-head">Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>First person</strong></th>
    <td>mi (I)</td>
    <td>ni (we)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Second person</strong></th>
    <td>vi (you)</td>
    <td>vi (you)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Third person</strong></th>
    <td>
      li (he)<br>
      ŝi (she)<br>
      ĝi (it)
    </td>
    <td>ili (they)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Indefinite</strong></th>
    <td>oni (one, they, you)</td>
    <td>oni (one, they, you)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Reflexive</strong></th>
    <td>si (self)</td>
    <td>si (self)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Verbs

Verbs are not conjugated for person or number. The infinitive verb form ends in **-i**. Verbs in the imperative mood end in **-u**. Verbs in the conditional verb mood (_would be_) end in **-us**.

#### Verb forms

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th class="table-head">Singular</th>
    <th class="table-head">Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Present</strong></th>
    <td>-as</td>
    <td>-as</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Past</strong></th>
    <td>-is</td>
    <td>-is</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Future</strong></th>
    <td>-os</td>
    <td>-os</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

#### Participle forms
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th class="table-head">Active</th>
    <th class="table-head">Passive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Past</strong></th>
    <td>-inta</td>
    <td>-ita</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Present</strong></th>
    <td>-anta</td>
    <td>-ata</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="table-head"><strong>Future</strong></th>
    <td>-onta</td>
    <td>-ota</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Affixes

Esperanto uses a collection of [affixes](http://www.romaniczo.com/esperanto/gramatiko/grammar_13.html) to form its vocabulary.

To form compound words, the affixes are simply joined together.

Example:<br>
**pardono** (forgiveness) + **peti** (to seek) → **pardonpeti** (to apologize)

## Conclusion

I hope that this short article has helped you with the basic grammar of Esperanto. There are more topics to cover (e.g. the various prepositions), but this should give you a decent starting point. For further learning, I recommend the lessons on [Lernu](https://lernu.net).

[^1]: Common criticisms include the language's Eurocentrism (especially in regard to its lexicon), its "bizarre phonetic inventory", and the obnoxious nature of a small but vocal minority of the community.

[^2]: The personal pronoun _ri_, not included in the table, is an unofficial gender-neutral third person singular pronoun that has become relatively popular in recent years. Although not officially endorsed by the Akademio de Esperanto, it is widely understood amongst active Esperanto speakers.
