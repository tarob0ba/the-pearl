## What is Tailwind?

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. It was first introduced in 2019 and over time, it has grown a substantial amount of traction due to the appeal of the ability to have low level control over your HTML. Another useful feature is the elimination of default styles which gives the developer a blank canvas to work from. Due to its flexibility, it has rapidly become a big player in the world of CSS frameworks.

## Why I like Tailwind

I like Tailwind for three major reasons:

1. Tailwind is flexible.
   Because it is a blank canvas, you (the developer) have complete control. With utility classes, you can precisely control the appearance of your website without having to manage a complex CSS codebase.

2. Tailwind is simple.
   At its core are a set of utility classes based on CSS properties. It gives you the ability to see exactly what CSS is being applied to each element at a glance. This makes it easier for me to make tweaks during development down the line.

3. Tailwind enables rapid front-end development.
   With its utility classes, you can see your page take shape as you style it. Additionally, the new JIT can make incremental builds take as little as 3 milliseconds!

For these reasons, I choose to use Tailwind for development. Additionally, Tailwind adds of touch of modernity to websites developed with the clean font.

## Tailwind might not work for you

As with anything, there are downsides to Tailwind and it isn't the best tool for everyone. For one, build sizes can be atrocious depending on your purge config. Additionally, some of the class names are inconsistent and confusing which can slow down development. Finally, once you start using Tailwind for a project, it becomes very difficult to convert it back to traditional semantic CSS.

Thanks for reading and have a wonderful boba.ðŸ§‹
