Last night, I realized something. For my entire life (since I was three), I have held pens and pencils wrong. I noticed that nobody else in my house holds a pen the same way as I do. I have no idea when I picked up the grip that I have been using for as long as I can remember, but I suspect that I got it when I first started writing with pencils and crayons in preschool.

When I first realized this, I was shocked and slightly upset that I had been writing "wrong" for so long! I was honestly in disbelief because I was **sure** that I wrote the right way and that I wrote completely normally. However, I was wrong. I tried using the trifold grip and while I could write okay, the text I wrote felt too large and it was fairly slow. I bet that if I had stuck to the trifold grip for several weeks, my handwriting would improve, and my writing speed would also improve. I’m considering trying it, but I don’t know how it would work out.

## Pros of switching to a "proper" grip

1. With practice, I could write faster and _potentially_ improve my handwriting.
2. I will **hopefully** have less hand cramps while writing for long periods of time, which often discourage me from writing with a pen and paper instead of typing everything I write instead.
3. My handwriting will be more legible (although to be fair, it is still pretty good).

## Cons of switching to a "proper" grip

1. It will take a while to adjust to the new grip. During this time period, my handwriting and writing speed will suffer.
2. I have been writing like this for a long time and these habits are deeply ingrained in my muscle memory. Because of this, I will need to be conscious of the grip I use in order to not inadvertently switch to my old grip.
3. While trying to get a handle on the "proper" method, I might have more hand cramps.

I felt disappointed that I had been writing the "wrong" way for so long. However, I then realized something. I wasn't writing the wrong way.
In my opinion, there is only one way to write "wrong"; not writing at all. Words are truly beautiful and paint a stunning picture: colorful and breathtaking, with details that bring it all together. Without writing, our society would cease to exist.

We tell our stories in writing-- we share our lives.
We **need** writing.

So get out there, write something small, write something beautiful!<br />
The only wrong way to write is to not write at all.
